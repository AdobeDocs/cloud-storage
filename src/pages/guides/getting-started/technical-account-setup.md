API calls made using **OAuth Server-to-Server** are made using a Technical Account. This account is created automatically when you added Server-to-Server authentication to your Developer Console Project (refer to [Generate API key and access token](./developer-console.md) for instructions). However, you must configure the the Technical Account permissions and product assignments to allow it to access the Adobe cloud storage conent.

**Note:** You must be an Administrator for your organization to configure the Technical Account.

## Technical Account permissions

To grant permissions to the Technical Account:

1. Sign in to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) using your user account profile for your organization.
2. Go to the **Users** tab

3. Choose **API Credentials** from the menu on the left.
4. Locate the credential associated with the Developer Console project that needs access to Adobe cloud storage. Click **View details** icon to see information about the credential.

## Technical Account product assignment

In order to access Adobe cloud storage, the Technical Account must be assigned at least one license to a product that includes Enterprise Storage. If the Server-to-Server credential was created using an API that includes Enterprise Storage, then the Technical Account is automatically assigned the appropriate product license.

However, if the Server-to-Server credential was created using an API that does not include Enterprise Storage, then you will need to assign a product license using the Admin Console. This is true even if an API with Enterprise Storage was added to the credential later on.

To grant a Technical Account a product license the includes Enterprise Storage:

1. Sign in to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com) using your user account profile for your organization.
2. Go to the **Users** tab

   ![Adobe Admins Console](../images/admin_console_start.png)

3. Choose **API Credentials** from the menu on the left.
4. Locate the credential associated with the Developer Console project that needs access to Adobe cloud storage. Click **View details** icon to see information about the credential.

5. Add a product license by clicking on the "..." next to Products. Then choose Edit Products
6. Click the + button and choose a product that includes Enterprise Storage.
