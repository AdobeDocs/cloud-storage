# Collaboration Constructs

The Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API provides programatic access to a set of constructs designed to facilitate asset management and team collaboration. Each construct serves distinct purposes, providing users with tailored environments for storing assets, organizing workflows, and achieving specific outcomes.

## Project

A project is a durable space used by teams to organize and collaborate on cloud documents and related cloud content.
It is a structured location containing related assets, specifically organized to achieve well-defined objectives within a set timeframe, helping teams stay focused on deliverables.
Projects can contain both files and folders.

## Folder

A folder is a continer to organize and store content. You can use folders to store files, or you can nest them together to create a folder hierarchy to keep your assets organized
Folders can contain files as well as other folders.

## File

Files are used to store content in Adobe's cloud storage. Files can be cloud documents that are optimized for web applications - such as Photoshop cloud (PSDC) and Adobe Express documents - or regular files typically used in conjunction with Adobe applicatons - such as jpeg, png, and mp4 files.
