# Best Practices for Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API

The Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration APIprovides powerful functionality for developers to integrate Adobe cloud storge into their applications. To ensure efficient and effective use of the API, it's important to follow best practices. This document outlines key recommendations for using the Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API.

## Authentication

Use OAuth 2.0 for authentication to ensure secure access to API resources. Store client credentials securely and never expose them in client-side code.

### Credential Scope, Client Id, and Client Secret

Store credential details - Scopees, Client Id,  and Client Secret, securely and do not hard code them in the application. Note that Scopes are subject to change and should be verified periodically.

## API Requests

Use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure data privacy and security. Follow the API documentation for correct endpoint usage and parameter formatting. Handle rate limiting by implementing exponential backoff and retry mechanisms.

## Security

Validate user input to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. Regularly update API client libraries and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and Logging

Implement logging to track API usage, errors, and performance metrics. Monitor API usage and performance to identify and address issues proactively.
