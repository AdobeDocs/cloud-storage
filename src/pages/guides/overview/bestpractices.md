# Best practices for Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration APIs

The Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API provides powerful functionality for developers to integrate Adobe's cloud storage into their applications. To ensure efficient and effective use of the API, it is important to follow best practices. This document outlines key recommendations for using the Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API.

## Authentication and client credentials

- Authenticate using OAuth 2.0 to ensure secure access to API resources.
- As access tokens are valid for 24 hours, ensure a token refresh mechanism is in place to maintain continuous access without interruptions.
- Keep client credentials safe. Never expose the Client ID, Client Secret, scopes, or access tokens in client-side code.
- Regularly rotate your credential secrets to enhance your application's security posture.
- Request only the scopes essential for your application's functionality, in line with the principle of least privilege. **Note:** Scope availability may change over time, so review it periodically.

## API requests

- Always use HTTPS to safeguard data privacy and ensure secure communication.
- Refer to the API documentation for correct endpoint usage and parameter formatting.
- Handle rate limiting by implementing exponential backoff and retry mechanisms.

## Security

- Validate user input to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Regularly update API client libraries and dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

## Monitoring and logging

- Implement logging to track API usage, errors, and performance metrics. 
- Continuously monitor API usage and performance to identify and address issues proactively.
