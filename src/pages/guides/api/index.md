# API reference

The Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API provides programmatic access to content stored in Adobe Cloud Storage for your organization. With the Adobe Cloud Storage and Collaboration API, you can interact with projects, folders, and files to automate creative production workflows and integrate Adobe Cloud Storage with your existing systems.

## Connecting to the Cloud Storage and Collaboration API

Before using the Cloud Storage and Collaboration API, you must create a development project in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/). This integration registers your application as a client of the Cloud Storage and Collaboration API, and gprovides the credentials required to authorize API calls.

- For setup instructions, see [Developer Console](../getting-started/developer-console.md)
- For information about client credential authentication and retrieving Client ID, Client Secret, Scopes, or access tokens, see [Authentication Setup](../getting-started/authentication.md).

## Cloud Storage API Calls

AApplications can use the API to access and manage projects, folders, and files in Adobe enterprise cloud storage. You can create and list projects, assign user roles, manage folders, upload and download files, and more.

For more information on content structures, see [Cloud Storage and Collaboration Concepts](../overview/constructs.md).

All API requests should be directed to the Cloud Storage and Collaboration API server:

```bash
https://cloudstorage.adobe.io/v1
```

## Summary of Actions on Cloud Content

### Projects

Projects are durable spaces used by teams to organize and collaborate on cloud documents and related cloud content.
